# Sorting Visualizer

This project is a tool to visualize different sorting algorithms build using React.js. Visualizing algorithms in visualizing tool is not just fascinating but also gives better understanding of algorithms. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it.
